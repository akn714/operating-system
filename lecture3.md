***Process***
* Process is a sequence of instructions executed in a pre-defined order.
* Any program that is executed is termed as process.
* Process can change their states as they execute and can be either new, ready, running, waiting or terminated.
* A process in OS is managed by *Process Control Block (PCB)*.

***Thread***
* Light weight process
* Sub-tasks of a process
* Each thread belongs to exactly one process.
* In a multi-threaded os, a process can consist of many threads.
* Threads can be effective only if the CPU is more than one otherwise the threads have to context switch for that single CPU.
