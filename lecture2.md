#### Goals of Operating Systems
* Maximum CPU Utilization
* we do not need process starvation
    * we don't want that only one process uses CPU, we want CPU to used by every process
    * Starvation is a problem of resource management where in the OS, the process does not have resources because it is being used by other processes.
* High priority job executing

### Types of Operating Systems
***Single Process OS*** 
* single job executing at a time
* eg. MS DOS

***Batch Processing OS***
* Similar Jobs/Tasks/Processes are combined together to make batches
* After that, batches are executed one by one
* ATLAS

***Multi-Programming OS***
* More than one task is executed at a time.
* Context switching
* THE

***Multi-Processing OS***
* More than one processor executes the tasks
* Context switching
* Time sharing
* WINDOWS

***Multi-Tasking OS***
* Time sharing
* CTSS

***Multi-Threading OS***

***Distributed OS***
* Loosely coupled OS
* Loosely coupled autonomus interconnected computers

***Real-Time OS (RTOS)***
* Error chance very less
* Execution fast
* Mostely used in militery areas
